To compile:
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 `root-config --cflags` -o braggPlot05 *.cc `root-config --libs`
		
Notes: In order to be able to run the files, make sure that the files
bragg_events.txt and energyRanges are present in the same directory as
the exectutables.

To run:
./braggPlot05 (...input options...) (...analysis options...) (...ranges options...)

INPUT OPTIONS: (you must include exactly one of these options)
1) INPUT FROM FILE
Option: "input bragg_events.txt"
The program read input events from the file bragg_events.txt.
2) SIMULATED INPUT
Option: sim <numberOfEvents> [seed]
The program takes as input a number of simulated random events equal to numberOfEvents parameter.
The random numbers are generated uniformly in the interval [0:99] using the seed parameter (optional).
The interval can be changed in the constants.h file.

ANALYSIS OPTIONS: (you must include at least one option. You can also include all of them, in any order.)
1) DUMP DATA
Option: "dump"
The program displays on the screen the list of all the read (from file or simulated) energies.
2) STATISTICS AND HISTOGRAMS
Option: "dist <token_name>" + "ranges energyRanges"
The <token_name> can be any string. This will be the initial part
of the names of the saved histograms. For example, if you type
"dist h", the program will save the histograms: hBackground.root,
hAfricium.root, hAustralium.root, hAsium.root, hHists.root, and
hTotalEnergies.root. Do not insert token names as "h.root". "h" is enough.
You must include also the option "ranges energyRanges" in this case,
in order to make the program know where to read the energy ranges
with which perform the statistics.
3) BACKGROUND LEVEL
Option: "bgcalc"
The program will compute and display the background energy level (average level of Bragg curves' tails).

RANGES OPTION: (include this if you are using the "dist" statistical option)
1) RANGES FROM FILE
Option: "ranges energyRanges".
This will tell the program to read the file "energyRanges", and to retrieve from it the labels
and the ranges of total energy for the events.

To compile:
execute the script "compile" with ./compile
		
Notes: The files will be compiled into several dynamic libraries.
Several executables will be made: runAll, runDist, runBGCalc, runDump.
In order to be able to run the files, make sure that the files
bragg_events.txt and energyRanges are present in the same directory as
the exectutables.
Make sure also that this directory is included in the environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (Type the last command printed out by the
run of the "compile" script in order to achieve this.)

To run:
- runDist) Exe that supports only the option "dump", useful to print
data.
Run with: ./runDump input bragg_events.txt dump
Or with: ./runDump sim <numberOfEvents> [seed] dump

- runBGCalc) Exe that supports only the option "bgcalc", useful to compute
the background energy level.
Run with: ./runBGCalc input bragg_events.txt bgcalc
Or with: ./runBGCalc sim <numberOfEvents> [seed] bgcalc

- runDist) Exe that supports only the option "dist <token_name>", useful to 
make statistics and to save histograms (.root files).
The <token_name> can be any string. This will be the initial part
of the names of the saved histograms. For example, if you type
"dist h", the program will save the histograms: hBackground.root,
hAfricium.root, hAustralium.root, hAsium.root, hHists.root, and
hTotalEnergies.root. Do not insert token names as "h.root". "h" is enough.
You must include also the option "ranges energyRanges" in this case,
in order to make the program know where to read the energy ranges
with which perform the statistics.
Run with: ./runDump input bragg_events.txt ranges energyRanges dist <token_name>
Or with: ./runDump sim <numberOfEvents> [seed] ranges energyRanges dist <token_name>

- runAll) Exe with all functionalities.
Run by typing at least one input option (i.e. "input bragg_events.txt"
or "sim <numberOfEvents> [seed]").
Run by inserting in command line any combination of options, among:
"dump", "dist <token_name>", and "bgcalc".
Remember to insert in the command line options the option "ranges energyRanges",
if you chosed to include "dist <token_name>".

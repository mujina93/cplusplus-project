---- Modify v03 and use interfaces for event read and process ----

Replace "read", "dump" and "stat" global functions to use classes with 
abstract interfaces, as described in the following.

***
Take following files from example "particleMean_v04":
- AnalysisSteering.h ,
- AnalysisSteering.cc ,
- EventSource.h ,
- EventSource.cc ,
- EventReadFromFile.h ,
- EventDump.h .
All these files can be used with no modification

***
Complete the following files:
- EventReadFromFile.cc : include in function "readFile" the code
                         formerly in the global function "read",
- EventDump.cc         : include in function "process" the code
                         formerly in the global function "dump".
***
Create a class "EnergyDist", inheriting from "AnalysisSteering" and 
containing a STL array of pointers to "BraggStatistic" objects; use 
as example the class "ParticleStatistic" in "particleMean_v04".
Implement the functions:
- "beginJob" to create and store the pointers to 4 "BraggStatistic" objects 
  for the 3 energy ranges and background,
- in "endJob" loop over the "BraggStatistic" objects and for each one 
  compute mean and rms energies and print results,
- in "process" loop over the "BraggStatistic" objects and for each one 
  call the "add" function.

***
Modify the "main" function to use the modified classes using the 
file "main.cc" from example "particleMean_v04" as reference: change the 
analyzers ("EnergyDist" in place of "ParticleStatistic") and remove 
the simulation part.

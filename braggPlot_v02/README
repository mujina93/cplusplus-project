To run:
./braggPlot02 (...input options...)

INPUT OPTIONS: (you must include exactly one of these options)
1) INPUT FROM FILE
Option: "input bragg_events.txt"
The program read input events from the file bragg_events.txt.
2) SIMULATED INPUT
Option: sim <numberOfEvents> [seed]
The program takes as input a number of simulated random events equal to numberOfEvents parameter.
The random numbers are generated uniformly in the interval [0:99] using the seed parameter (optional).
The interval can be changed in the constants.h file.

Notes: The program will ask you if you want to dump data or go directly to the statistical output.
The program will also save a histogram for each of the 4 ranges (background, Africium, Asium, Australium), and another .root file that contains all of these histograms.
